		| Hm, seems like the information you submitted isn't quite right. Try again.
	p Can't make it to the World Domination Summit after all? So sorry to miss you!
	p We'll do our best to accommodate transfer requests for a $100 fee up to 60 days prior to the big event in July.
	p If you find someone who wants your ticket, you can donate or sell it to them for up to the same price you paid (no premiums, please), and then use the following form to finish the transfer.
	p Hope to see you next year!

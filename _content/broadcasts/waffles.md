headline: Make history this summer! Join us for our third world record attempt.

#When was the last time you broke a world record by eating breakfast? Never, that's when.

That's about to change... 

It's not often you get the opportunity to create something truly extraordinary by doing something that happens every day. That's why today is your lucky day.

This July, thousands of people will descend on Portland for the 5th annual World Domination Summit. With so many amazing folks coming to town, we wanted to find a way to bring our attendees together with Portlanders to accomplish something both meaningful and memorable.

That's when it came to us in a dream: What about the world's biggest breakfast in bed party? Then, we woke up craving waffles.

After successfully setting two other world records, we're back for our third attempt.

All that's missing is you.

# The WDS Foundation seeks to put the right resources in the hands of amazing people who are acting on the three core values of WDS—community, adventure, service. 

We do this by providing what we call “Scholarships For Real Life.” The goal of these scholarships is to empower individuals to pursue their dreams and impact their community. 

Have a crazy project you want to bring to life? Want to take a trip around the earth and share what you learned with the world? Trying to build something that’s a bit out of your reach? Whatever it is, the WDS Foundation can help fund it. We look for inspiring projects that will improve your life *and* make the world a better place.

### Eligibility

For our first year of the “Scholarships for Real Life” program, we’re opening the application only to those who have attended or will be attending a World Domination Summit. As the program progresses, we intend to open this up to a wider audience—so check back next year if you’re not currently eligible.

### Selection Criteria

Our selection committee will be looking at a number of factors to determine which projects best fit with our current goals. Here are the main questions applicants will need to address:

### Register To Be A Mentor

One of the cornerstones of the World Domination Summit is adventure, and WDS attendees certainly know how to celebrate living unconventionally. Many of us are driven by the journey, and enjoy striking out on our own in search of new opportunities and experiences. Yet, we also know and appreciate the value of community—having someone to share the ups and downs of our journey and to help us reflect on what we’ve learned. It is this combination of adventure and community that brings us back each July for the World Domination Summit, and also the motivation for this blog post.

As part of the WDS Foundation “Scholarships For Real Life” program, each of our Voyagers receive mentoring to help guide them through their projects. Sometimes the mentoring is for specific tasks or goals, while at other times the mentoring is meant to be more long-term and includes big-picture guidance. 

We know the WDS community has a lot to offer, which a wide-range of knowledge and skills from which our Voyagers from could benefit. As we gear up for our 2015 applications, we’d like to give our community members a chance to share their expertise by signing up as a mentor in advance.

If you would like to contribute your knowledge and expertise to our Voyagers, whether that be for an hour or a full-year, we’d sincerely appreciate your help. Simply fill out the form below and we’ll be in contact when we have a need for your skills!

The WDS Foundation seeks to put the right resources in the hands of amazing people who are acting on the three core values of WDS—<i>community</i>, <i>adventure</i>, and <i>service</i>. 

We do this by providing what we call "Scholarships For Real Life." The goal of these scholarships is to empower individuals to pursue their dreams and impact their community. 

Have a crazy project you want to bring to life? Want to take a trip around the earth and share what you learned with the world? Trying to build something that’s a bit out of your reach? Whatever it is, the WDS Foundation can help fund it. We look for inspiring projects that will improve your life *and* make the world a better place.

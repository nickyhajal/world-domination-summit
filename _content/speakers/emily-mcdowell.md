**Emily McDowell** is a writer, illustrator, and entrepreneur who specializes in chronicling the human condition. In 2012, she left a successful career in advertising to launch her greeting card line, making cards for the relationships we actually have. Now a multimillion-dollar stationery and gift company, Emily McDowell Studio products are sold online at [emilymcdowell.com](http://emilymcdowell.com) and in nearly 2,000 stores worldwide. In 2015, Emilyâ€™s Empathy Cards, designed to help people connect around serious illness and loss, struck a nerve around the world. Her first book, *There Is No Good Card For This: What To Say and Do When Life Gets Scary, Awful, and Unfair To People You Love*, will be released in January 2017.

**Chris Guillebeau** is a New York Times bestselling author and modern-day explorer.

During a lifetime of self-employment that included a four-year commitment as a volunteer executive in West Africa, he visited every country in the world (193 in total) before his 35th birthday. Since then he has modeled the proven definition of an entrepreneur: “Someone who will work 24 hours a day for themselves to avoid working one hour a day for someone else.”

Chris’s first book, *The Art of Non-Conformity*, was translated into more than twenty languages. His second book, *The $100 Startup*, was a New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller, selling more than 300,000 copies worldwide. *The Happiness of Pursuit* was published in September 2014 and was also a New York Times bestseller, and he just published *Born For This* in May 2016.

Every summer in Portland, Oregon, Chris hosts the World Domination Summit, a gathering of creative, remarkable people with thousands in attendance. Chris is also the founder of Pioneer Nation, Unconventional Guides, the Travel Hacking Cartel, and numerous other projects.

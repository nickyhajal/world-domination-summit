## Emiliya Zhivotovskay | 2016 Speaker

# “The hero’s journey—the need to tell a story—has woven into the fabric of what it means to be human. And as we learn to talk differently to ourselves, to do the heavy lifting, we transcend being ‘homo sapien’ and ‘homo narrativus’, to become ‘homo florentissimo’—we become flourishing man.”

At the age of 5, Emiliya and her family fled from Kiev, escaping the fall of Communism and the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl.

Instead of giving up and blaming the world she found awakening, strength and a renewed sense of gratitude. Her goal is to help others flourish in the face of adversity.

**Reverend angel Kyodo Williams** is an author, activist, master trainer and founder of the Center for Transformative Change. She has been bridging the worlds of transformation and justice since releasing her critically acclaimed book, *Being Black: Zen and the Art of Living With Fearlessness and Grace*. She is one of only three black women Zen "senseis" and applies wisdom teachings and embodied practice to intractable social issues at the intersections of climate change, racial and economic justice, and Transformative Social Change.

Her 27 Days of Change online program and 3rd Way Leadership supports changemakers worldwide. Her work has been widely covered, including in *The New York Times*, *Boston Globe*, *Ms.*, and *Essence*.  Her newest book collaboration, *Radical Dharma: Talking Race, Love, and Liberation* was released on Juneteenth—a day that symbolizes and holds forth the promise of Black Liberation—of this year. Rev. angel notes, "Love and Justice are not two. Without inner change, there can be no outer change. Without collective change, no change matters."

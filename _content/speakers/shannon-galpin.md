National Geographic Adventurer of the Year and global activist **Shannon Galpin** founded the Colorado based non-profit <a href="http://mountain2mountain.org" target="_blank">Mountain2Mountain</a> to fight for women’s rights in conflict zones. Shannon started in Afghanistan creating projects that focused on empowering women and girls through education, art, and sport. She has worked to support graffiti artists in Kabul and created the groundbreaking *Streets of Afghanistan* photography installation which was set up as a series of street-art exhibitions around Afghanistan.

In 2009 she became the first person to mountain bike in Afghanistan, something she continued to do throughout the past 5 years in various areas of the country to explore and to challenge gender barriers for women. She now supports and trains the first Afghan Women’s National Cycling team and is preparing to launch her newest art installation, *Cross the Line*.

Shannon and her work have been highlighted in the press including features in *The New York Times*, NBC Dateline, *Outside Magazine*, BBC World, NBC Nightly News, ESPN, and *Women’s Adventure*. Shannon’s memoir, *Mountain to Mountain: A Journey of Adventure and Activism for the Women of Afghanistan*, releases September 16th, 2014, and she is the producer for the upcoming documentary film, *Afghan Cycles*, about the Afghan National Women’s Cycling Team premiering spring 2015.

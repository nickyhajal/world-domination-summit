## 2012 Speaker

# "Action is the key to change...It's not the things we say that are our priorities; it's the things we do." Using his own life as an example, J.D. Roth explores three steps to personal transformation: the power of yes, the power of focus, and the power of action.

J.D. Roth is an accidental personal-finance expert—a regular guy who found himself deep in debt. After deciding to turn his life around, he read everything he could about money and finance. To share what he learned, he started the award-winning blog Get Rich Slowly (getrichslowly.org) in 2006, which Money magazine named the Web’s most inspiring personal-finance blog and which *Time* magazine named one of the 25 best blogs of 2011.

Over the past decade, Roth has undergone a series of personal transformations. He’s paid off over $35,000 in consumer debt, built a successful business, and saved a sizeable nest egg. He’s lost 50 pounds, completed a marathon, a century ride, and now regularly lifts heavy weights just for fun. He’s leaped out of an airplane, trekked the Peruvian Andes, leapt into the Zambezi gorge, and soon hopes to visit Antarctica. He’s learned Spanish, published a book, and, most scary of all, started to date again!

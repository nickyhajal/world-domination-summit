<div class="zig-zags_blue"></div>

**Mr Money Mustache** (Pete Adeney in real life) retired with his wife at the age of 30 to start a family. Six years into his new life, he realized his peers were still not only stuck in their well-paying jobs, but barely able to meet their ever-increasing lifestyle inflation bills.

Pete formed the blog [Mr Money Mustache](link: http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/) to teach fellow Americans how to live a slightly less ridiculous life than average in order to amass an incredible surplus of money while still young and able to put it to good use. The blog has reached over 16 million people and become a study on life, happiness, and the joy of being able to focus on work that means something to you.

**John Francis** is known the wold over as the Planetwalker, and is the author of *Planetwalker: 17-Years of Silence, 22-Years of Walking*, and *The Ragged Edge of Silence: Finding Peace in a Noisy World*, published by the National Geographic Society.

John began his environmental work in 1971, when he witnessed a tanker collision and oil spill in San Francisco Bay. He gave up the use of motorized vehicles and began to walk, because he felt partly responsible for the mess that washed up on the shore. Several months later, on his 27th birthday, because of the arguments his decision to walk seemed to create, John took a vow of silence lasting 17 years.

During that time, he founded Planetwalk, a non-profit environmental awareness organization, received a B.S. degree from Southern Oregon State College, a Masters degree in Environmental Studies from the University of Montana-Missoula, and a PhD in Land Resources from the Gaylord Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Ending his silence, John served as project manager for the United States Coast Guard Oil Pollution Act Staff of 1990, in Washington, DC.

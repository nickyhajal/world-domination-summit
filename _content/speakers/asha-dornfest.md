**Asha Dornfest** is a writer. For the last 20 years, she’s written books and articles about everything from building websites to raising kids, most recently, *Minimalist Parenting* with co-author Christine Koh. 

In 2005, Ash founded <a href="http://parenthacks.com" target="_blank">Parent Hacks</a>, an award-winning blog that celebrates parents’ unconventional discoveries and clever life hacks. Since then, Asha’s work has been featured in the *Wall Street Journal*, *Real Simple*, *Family Circle*, *Parents*, *Parenting*, and more. She’s been a guest (billed, ironically, as a parenting expert) on local and national television shows and radio broadcasts, including CNN, ABC News Now and the Ronn Owens Show. Asha has also spoken about writing, entrepreneurship, and online community building at SXSW, BlogHer, Mom 2.0 Summit, and TechFest NW. 
Asha’s next book, an illustrated collection of the best of Parent Hacks, is forthcoming from Workman Publishing in 2016.

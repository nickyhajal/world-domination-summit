Michelle Poler was born and raised in Caracas, Venezuela. In 2007 she moved to the United States to pursue a career in Art Direction and Graphic Design. After years of being afraid, she decided she needed to break free from a limited lifestyle and start having real experiences. In 2015, she decided to face one of her fears everyday for 100 days. 

Sheâ€™s currently developing an online platform to help the rest of us face our fears. Learn more at [100dayswithoutfear.com](http://100dayswithoutfear.com/).

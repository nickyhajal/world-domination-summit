## Michelle Poler | 2016 Speaker

# “Instead of perceiving fear as an obstacle, I choose to see fear as an opportunity. An opportunity that can lead you to uncover your next big thing.”

**Michelle Poler** was born and raised in Caracas, Venezuela. In 2007, she moved to the United States to pursue a career in Art Direction and Graphic Design. After years of being afraid, she decided she needed to break free from a limited lifestyle and start having real experiences. In 2015, she decided to face one of her fears everyday for 100 days. 

She’s currently developing an online platform to help the rest of us face our fears. Learn more at [100dayswithoutfear.com](http://100dayswithoutfear.com/).

**André Hueston Mack** left a successful career with Citicorp Investment Services to found Mouton Noir Wines. Less than five years later, the business had grown from a joke to a multi-million dollar highly exclusive wine brand with a cult-like following. 
In 2011, based on the success of his own wine labels, Mack established Get Fraîche Cru, a boutique graphic design firm, for which he serves as creative director. Most recently, he authored and designed *Small Thyme Cooks*, the world’s first culinary coloring and activity book.

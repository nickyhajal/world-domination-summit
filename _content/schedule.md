<p class="intro">We'll all arrive in the city for registration on Friday afternoon and an opening party on Friday evening. The main event kicks off in the beautiful Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall on Saturday morning.</p>

Throughout both weekend days, we'll alternate between the main stage for speaker talks, a park area for a mini-festival, and several smaller spaces for attendee-led meetups. The evenings will find us set loose on the town, attending your choice of group events or just out on your own.

We'll conclude on Sunday evening with a Farewell party that goes as long as people are around. If you never need to sleep, afterparties and early-morning parties are scheduled for each day. And if you'd like to extend your WDS experience, additional [Academies](/academies) will be held on the days before and after the weekend.

### Main Stage

<a name="main-stage"></a>

<img src="/images/schedule/schedule-circle-1.png" id="schedule-circle-1"/>

We'll begin each morning in the Schnitzer Theatre, a beautiful auditorium where no seat is further than 100 feet from the stage. Speakers will share a short message that combines personal stories with practical ideas.

During breaks, you can visit the Highly Sensitive Person Lounge for a quick snooze—or just catch up with a new friend over a cup of coffee.

Most speakers will attend the entire weekend and be available for informal conversation.

<h3 class="color-green">Portland Experience</h3>

<a name="portland-experience"></a>

Over the years we've learned that two big reasons people come to WDS is to meet people with shared interests and experience some of what the great city of Portland has to offer. Since the WDS weekend is already a jam-packed affair, we've created **The Portland Experience**, a festival celebrating what makes Portland so great.

We're commandeering a 3-block section of the downtown Park Blocks and taking the best of Portland and bringing it directly to you. Food? Check. Drink? Check? Music, crafts, exercise? Check, check, and check.

Just steps from the Schnitzer you'll be able to connect with friends based on shared interests, and experience a side of the city you might not have seen otherwise.

The path to world domination starts in Portland, so it's about time you got to know the city!

<p class="color-green">**Note:** Need a break? Our Highly Sensitive Person zone will be open all afternoon. You can also attend your choice of 100+ attendee-led gatherings.</p>

<div class="line-canvas"></div>

### [Activities](/activities)

When main stage sessions end for the afternoon, the good times roll on. Join your fellow attendees at your choice of extracurricular activities around town—from film screenings and river cruises, to world record attempts and more!

Here's a sampling of the activities we had in 2014. [Learn more &rarr;](/activities)

<p class="color-blue">Note: all activities are first-come, first-served, and some require registration in advance.</p>

<h4 class="color-orange">Attendee Meetups</h3>
<img src="/images/schedule/schedule-circle-3.png" id="schedule-circle-3"/>
<p></p>
<p>Both days, we'll set aside time for attendees to host informal meetups. You can go from the Get Rich Slowly meetup to the Location Independent meetup—and then over to the Minimalist group, where a fight will likely break out over who owns the fewest things.</p>
<p>And if you have your own audience, you can host a meetup too. (Our dedicated attendee web app will tell you where each meetup is being held.)</p>

<div class="half-col">
	<h4 class="color-orange">Meet the Authors</h3>
	<p></p>
	<p>On Sunday afternoon—before we all head to the afterparty—we've set aside a space for our speakers to sign books and meet readers. Print books will be available for sale throughout the weekend, and if you're digital-only, you can stop by to say hi to your favorite author.
	</p>

<div class="half-col">
	<h4 class="color-orange">See the city</h3>
	<p></p>
	<p>Head out to see the town on your choice of self-guided walking tours in cooperation with other attendees. Tours will begin on Thursday night (prior to the official opening) and continue through the following Monday.

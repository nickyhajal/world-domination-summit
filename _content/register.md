# Ticket sales for WDS 2015 are now open for a limited time. Register now!!

Thanks for your interest in taking over the world. WDS tickets go very quickly, and the event has been completely sold out four years in a row. WDS 2015 is coming on **July 9–13**.

WDS is an adventure like no other, and next year will be *extra* special because it's our five-year anniversary. We'd love for you to join us… and now you can!

Until this round of tickets is sold out, you can register through the link below:

<a href="http://wds2015.eventbrite.com" class="button">Register &rarr;</a>

After this sale, we won't offer any additional tickets until sometime in 2015. We hope you'll join us if you haven't already planned to, and we hope you'll tell your friends and family to sign up too. The best is yet to come!

<!-- If you'd <strong>definitely like to attend next year</strong> and want to purchase a ticket once they're available, use the form below to put your name on the waiting list. When the sale is announced, all tickets will be offered on a first-come, first-served basis.

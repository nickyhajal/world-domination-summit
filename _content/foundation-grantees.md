### Jeff Rasmussen

<div><img class="grantee-pic" src="/images/grantees/jeff.jpg"/></div>

At 14 years old, Jeff is already a WDS veteran, having attended for the past two years. Since he was four years old, Jeff has had to endure bullying and judgement from his fellow students, and even teachers, because of his ADHD. Jeff is passionate about helping other kids suffering from ADHD to avoid similar bullying, as well as educating those who work with ADHD about the condition and how they can work with those individuals.

Jeff’s Scholarships for Real Life project is called “ADHD Kids Rock.” The initial goal with the WDS grant is to build an online community website that allows kids with ADHD to share their stories, and share best practices around what works and doesn’t work for them.  Ultimately, the site will expand to include stories from parents, teachers and others on what they’ve learned from interacting, teaching and raising ADHD kids. Additionally, Jeff will use the grant to attend a national conference on ADHD to spread the message of his site and gather more resources to share with the online community.

### Susan Sullivan

Susan feels she has found her calling when it comes to her Scholarships for Real Life project—First Clue. First Clue is a web-based media project that collects and shares stories from LGBT individuals answering the question, “What was your first clue that you were a lesbian, gay, bisexual and/or transgender?” Up until now the LGBTQ narrative has focused on the often painful and conflicted “when did you know?” and “coming out” stories. In contrast, first clue stories are often positive and upbeat, recalling a time when we trusted the truth of our experience and had faith in our basic goodness. These stories offer insight into our earliest intuitions that we know who we are and are at ease with ourselves until we are taught not to be by cultural influences. Simple yet powerful, these are overlooked and untold stories with the power to transform the way individuals and a community perceives itself.

The First Clue project will be comprised of three distinct elements: an online interactive Story Hub that enables participants to upload and share their first clue stories, live storytelling events that gather stories to be showcased on the Story Hub (e.g. festival and community screenings, pop up story events, events with partner organizations), and a travelling art exhibition of curated stories and photos reflecting the wide range of first clue stories shared by participants.

To prepare for this project, Susan took film classes at the Bay Area Video Coalition (BAVC), where she also was recently inducted into the MediaMaker Fellowship program. This ten-month program will provide lessons in project development, multiplatform and transmedia storytelling, marketing and more. This educational program will supplement the Scholarship for Real Life grant, which Susan will use to fund the website build out and live events.

### Linda Buchner

<div><img class="grantee-pic" src="/images/grantees/linda.jpg"/></div>

Linda has been running the MINDDRIVE program for the past four years. MINDDRIVE is an afterschool program for at‐risk high school students, whose mission is to inspire students to learn, expand their vision of the future and to have a positive influence on urban workforce development. The program achieves these ends by having students convert gas powered cars into electric vehicles.  At the end of the program, students go on a road trip to highlight and celebrate their success of restoring and converting a car that you can actually drive on the road, on the highway and in the city. 

One of the byproducts of the program is that students see the practical application of the seemingly endless hours learning algebra into a task they can touch, see and build—such as calculating the amp hours on a battery that will power a car, and how a bunch of batteries connected together can increase those hours. Last year’s program provided students with the opportunity to host a Congressional Briefing about how hands‐on learning leads to jobs. It was received with a standing‐room only crowd, including various politicians.

The funding from the Scholarship for Real Life grant will fund this year’s trip for 50 students and their mentors at the culmination of the 2014/15 program.

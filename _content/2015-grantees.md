School teachers in urban districts face special challenges in promoting their students’ long-term academic success. It is no surprise that so-called “failing” schools are disproportionately situated in urban centers with high rates of poverty and crime. Valerie Groth is a mission to change that for Chicago-area students. In 2014, she founded Ryan Banks Academy, a coeducational boarding school that seeks to impact the lives of students through a rigorous college and career preparatory education, a supportive boarding program, and a focus on personal development in a positive environment.  The goal of Ryan Banks Academy is to teach students not only the value of education, but also encourage them to focus on cultivating their own unique strengths, interests, and passions so that they may lead a purpose-filled life. Curriculum focuses not only on academic pursuits, but also on developing their relationships, core values, and mindset. 

There are many steps in her journey to build the school, and the Scholarship for Real Life grant will be helping get her fundraising efforts of the ground, as well as help support her burgeoning volunteer program. She is currently looking for assistance with grant writing and donor outreach, as well as anyone with a background in curriculum development.

Imagine yourself right now as a seven year old child whose family has just lost everything in a flood. Or as a ten year old who has just landed in a shelter because the abuse at home got so bad that mom finally took the kids and fled for her life. What kind of dreams would fill your sleep? Who would be there reminding you “I believe in you! You can do it!” What would it mean to you to open a beautiful gift box and see inside a stuffed bear, shiny barrettes, a box of pencils, a clean t-shirt and a new toothbrush?

The Dream Box Project works with volunteers from all over North America to pack boxes full of school supplies, toiletries and toys, before delivering them to children in distressed living situations. Each box lid is decorated with a message of hope from the volunteer responsible. Not only does the project making a difference in the lives of children everywhere, but engages the hearts and minds of volunteers by enabling them to help non-profit organizations in a meaningful way. 

Denise will be using her Scholarship funds to systemize her process, so groups all over the world can launch box building events of their own. She is currently looking for assistance with graphic design, system mapping, shipping logistics and management, and video production.

The process of writing, choosing supportive media assets, and bringing the story to the screen provides a platform for healing unique to the mental health therapies.

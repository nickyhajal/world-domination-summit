School teachers in urban districts face special challenges in promoting their students’ long-term academic success. It is no surprise that so-called “failing” schools are disproportionately situated in urban centers with high rates of poverty and crime. Valerie Groth is a mission to change that for Chicago-area students. In 2014, she founded Ryan Banks Academy, a coeducational boarding school that seeks to impact the lives of students through a rigorous college and career preparatory education, a supportive boarding program, and a focus on personal development in a positive environment.  The goal of Ryan Banks Academy is to teach students not only the value of education, but also encourage them to focus on cultivating their own unique strengths, interests, and passions so that they may lead a purpose-filled life. Curriculum focuses not only on academic pursuits, but also on developing their relationships, core values, and mindset. 

There are many steps in her journey to build the school, and the Scholarship for Real Life grant will be helping get her fundraising efforts of the ground, as well as help support her burgeoning volunteer program. She is currently looking for assistance with grant writing and donor outreach, as well as anyone with a background in curriculum development.

The process of writing, choosing supportive media assets, and bringing the story to the screen provides a platform for healing unique to the mental health therapies.

### Ben & Amberlynn Slavin

SnapType breaks down the barriers to education and helps students survive in a school system that wasn’t designed for them. The app enables students to complete any school worksheet on an iPad.

An estimated 1 in 5 people have difficulty expressing themselves through writing. For students, that can lead to falling behind in class, emotional problems at home, low self-esteem, and a sense of hopelessness. When Amberlynn Slavin was doing her fieldwork as an occupational therapy graduate student, she worked with a child who had dysgraphia - a learning disability that makes handwriting incredibly messy.

Together with her husband, Ben Slavin, they created an app to take a picture of a worksheet and then simply type the answers in on the screen. Feedback from the community has been extremely positive! The challenge they face now is that there are 4 times as many Android devices used around the world than there are Apple. To make SnapType work on Android, they have to re-write the app from the ground up in a completely different programming language.

A WDS Foundation scholarship was granted to help fund the development of SnapType for Android. Soon, students around the world will be given the chance to have more independence, self confidence and the opportunity to keep up with their peers!

Kasha Sequoia Slavner is an 18-year old filmmaker/photographer, author, social entrepreneur, young global leader & peace advocate.  As a concerned high school student, disillusioned and outraged by the negativity and powerlessness she felt as a consumer of mainstream media, Kasha was compelled to find an alternative narrative. With her mom Marla’s blessing and mentorship, she launched The Global Sunrise Project, a social impact media hub focused on sharing solution-oriented stories about some of the world’s most pressing issues. Taking a year off school, with the help of community, she sets out on her 16th birthday on an ambitious mission to travel the world for six months with her mom for the purpose of documenting stories of hope, resilience. empowered leadership. With a DSLR camera in hand and no clear itinerary or roadmap, Kasha finds herself intersecting with the lives of people determined to rise above adversity and shares their insights to inspire others to find it within their own hearts to take action, no matter how small, and to live out their purpose and passion in a way that contributes to the betterment of the world. 

With the generous help of the WDS Scholarship for Real Life grant, Marla and Kasha will be able to move The Global Sunrise Project forward in a timely manner, enabling Kasha to finish the post-production of her first feature length documentary film _**The Sunrise Storyteller©**_,  submit it to film festivals, launch a film website and publish the hardcover edition of her book _**Reflections of the Sunrise Storyteller - A Journey into the Heart as a Global Citizen©**_. 

2017 plans include a tour with the film, exhibition & book, as well as accompanying keynote, workshop and development of a community engagement platform. As part of their mandate for social good, between 10-25% of net proceeds are donated back to grassroots organizations.

### Kathleen and Joe Sindorf

There are countless, huge problems that humanitarians and activists around the world are working hard to alleviate. Unfortunately, far too many of these hard-working people are working in a vacuum, isolated from the support of an informed and energized community. 

At its core, the problem is a failure to effectively communicate what they’re doing. Learning to use simple, effective video storytelling skills could make a tremendous difference in the success of their causes.

Kathleen and Joseph Sindorf are award-winning television professionals, who have worked in more than 75 countries. Kathleen is a university professor, and Joseph is a documentary filmmaker. Their experiences have given them a passion to share their professional knowledge with those who are working hard to make a difference in the world.

The Sindorfs have taught people in five countries how to use their smartphones to create short videos to compel viewers to get involved in their work. The WDS “Scholarship for Real Life” will allow them to expand this training to create “Global Video Academy” – an online learning environment to allow people everywhere to learn to use video more effectively. 

Part of this training will be developed internationally, including a teaching trip with a group of university students who will be creating digital media stories among Syrian and Iraqi refugees in Amman, Jordan. They will use social media and their new video skills to communicate their experiences back home to their communities. 

You can follow the Sindorfs’ adventures as they develop this project. Just go to [GlobalVideoAcademy.com](http://www.globalvideoacademy.com).

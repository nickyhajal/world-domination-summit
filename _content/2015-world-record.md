### When was the last time you broke a world record by eating breakfast? Never, that's when.

We came, we saw, we set a freakin' world record (for the second time)!

On July 11, 2014, 808 WDSers and local Portlanders braved the heat and the crowds to officially break the Guinness World Record for "World's Longest Yoga Chain" while hundreds of others cheered us on.

After months of planning, Pioneer Courthouse Square in Downtown Portland filled with yoga and world record enthusiasts for an hour long series of yoga chains, officially snagging the title away from India.

The event was a fun, meaningful display of what's possible when a community comes together for a common purpose. If you joined us at The Great Namaste, thanks for being there. If you didn't, watch this space for details about how to participate in next year's event!

## Worldwide Waffles: Make Breakfast In Bed History!

# When was the last time you broke a world record by eating breakfast? Never, that's when.

<a name="worldwide-waffles"></a>

That's about to change... 

It's not often you get the opportunity to create something truly extraordinary by doing something that happens every day. That's why today is your lucky day.

This July, thousands of people will descend on Portland for the 5th annual World Domination Summit. With so many amazing folks coming to town, we wanted to find a way to bring our attendees together with Portlanders to accomplish something both meaningful and memorable.

That's when it came to us in a dream: *What about the world's biggest breakfast in bed party? Then, we woke up craving waffles.*

After successfully setting [two](http://worlddominationsummit.com/2013-world-record) [other](http://worlddominationsummit.com/2014-world-record) world records, we're back for our third attempt.

All that's missing is you. Welcome to *Worldwide Waffles*.

*800+ fun people breaking a record with us in Pioneer Courthouse Square last year.*

# What It's All About

**Q:** What do Shangahi, China and Portland, Oregon have in common?

**A:** Not much! That is, until we hold the world's biggest breakfast in bed party, overtaking Shanghai's current record.

On **Friday, July 10**, 600 Portlanders and travelers from around the world will come together to celebrate community, adventure, and service by gathering in Pioneer Courthouse Square to share a light, catered breakfast... in bed.

* It's a **community event** because it brings fun, likeminded people together who otherwise wouldn't meet each other without a crazy goal to achieve.
* It's an **adventure** because... well... when was the last time you ate breakfast in bed with 600 other people?
* And it's a **service event** because our combined efforts will make life better for some of the most at risk people in our community.
 
**Lets get real for a moment.**

What are two resources far too many people in our community lack? Food and shelter. Every day, hundreds of people all around you—right here in Portland, don't have adequate shelter. And many more who have a place to live don't have the resources to feel comfortable in their own homes.

It just so happens that, to make a world record like this come together, you have to have a lot of beds. Like, a lot a lot.
As part of a strategic partnership, we'll be donating all the beds from the event to [The Community Warehouse](https://www.communitywarehouse.org/), a fantastic local organization that helps families get back on their feet.

Your participation in *Worldwide Waffles* will directly benefit those in need in your community.

*Last year, we donated yoga mats. This year we'll be putting 150 beds in homes that need them around Portland.*

# How To Participate

There are two important qualifications you'll need to meet in order to participate in this record-breaking event:

1. **Experience sitting in a bed.** You should be comfortable with all tasks required to sit and/or lay in bed. TV in bed skills appreciated, but not required.
2. **Proficiency in eating breakfast.** You should be very experienced with all breakfast eating technology, including how to use utensils and chew food.

We don't believe these to be difficult barriers to entry and will attempt to make accomodations for those who need it.

**A note on food allergies:** We will attempt to make all accomodations necessary for major food allergies but, because our menu will not be confirmed until just before the event, we cannot guarantee the availability of food that is 100% free of every possible allergen.

*Hell... yes... waffles.*

# What To Bring

You don't need to bring much, but here are a few things you definitely need and a few things you might want:

1. Either your Eventbrite ticket (paper or digital) or photo id for entrance.
2. Sunscreen and a water bottle. It'll likely be sunny and hot. Come prepared for that.
3. A fun-loving attitude. Mandatory!
4. Your pajamas! Breakfast in bed wouldn't be the same if you weren't in your PJs. This isn't mandatory, but there will be a "best pajamas" contest, so bring your A game!

*This is a good example of what a fun-loving attitude looksl like.*

# Waiver And Disclaimer (The Lawyers Said We Had To…)

There aren’t a lot of risks involved in an event like this, but the lawyers tell us we’re supposed to make it very clear that your participation is strictly “at your own risk.”

The World Domination Summit—and any of its affiliated partners or members—will not accept any liability for your participation. You'll be required to sign a legal waiver at registration in order to participate.

Lastly, we're going to do everything we can to break the record, but we can't 100% guarantee it will happen. We need everyone to show up! In the unlikely event we don't break it, we'll plan to try again.

# Questions & Attempted Answers

**Will I get my own bed?**

No! You'll be sharing a bed with 3 other people for a nice, cozy experience. Breaking records ain't easy, afterall. But don't worry, if you have 3 friends you can guarantee will show up, you can reserve a bed for all 4 of you. All others will be considered "single riders" (like at Disneyland!) and will be placed to ensure maximum number of participants.

**What are you serving for breakfast?**

We're working with a number of local vendors to assemble a top notch à la carte menu. It won't be finalized until just before the event. We can only assure you that it will be delicious. Waffles seem like a strong bet.

**Can I bring a friend?**

You're darn right you can! We highly encourage you to bring your friends to this event. The best way to do this is to reserve a bed for 4 people and include their names and email addresses (super important so everyone receives updates about the event). If you come with fewer than 3 friends, you'll each need to register separately and make sure that you're together when you arrive.

We'll do our best to place you together but, because of the complex logistics, we cannot guarantee you'll be seated on the same bed unless you register as a group of 4.

**What if I have a food allergy?**

We will be working with our vendors to make sure we have appropriate options for those with food allergies and sensitivities (nuts, soy, gluten, dairy, etc.) but, just like any restaurant, we cannot guarantee we'll be able to cover every possible situation.

**Will I have fun if I don't know anyone there?**

Heck yes, you will! Every year, hundreds of people come to our record breaking events by themselves and leave with life-long friends. Something about making a little piece of history seems to create strong bonds.

If you want to meet some new friends, this is a great place to do it. Or, if you just want to come be a part of the fun without feeling the pressure to socialize, that’s possible, too. Yoga really is for everyone.

**Will the weather be good?**

This is Oregon, so we can’t promise anything. But we can’t remember the last time it rained on July 10, either. No really, we can’t remember at all; so we looked it up. The average rainfall for the month of July in Portland is 0.08 inches. That works out to less than .0026 inches for July 10. That's a roundabout way of saying: It will not be raining.

**Will this actually work? Will you break the record?**

Only if you show up! This is another variable we cannot guarantee, but we'll do everything we can to succeed. In fact, here’s a video of us breaking another world record last year with over 800 people at Pioneer Courthouse Square last year:

And here's another of us with 600+ on The Willamette River in 2013:

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/95986011" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

**Where will I put my stuff?**

Under your bed, where the monsters live!

**Can I transfer my ticket?**

Due to the nature of world records, all ticket sales are final and cannot be refunded or transferred. If you buy a ticket and are not able to come, though, please let us know so we can plan accordingly and ensure we still break the record.

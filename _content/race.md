## Unconventional Race 2015

#In 2012, we debuted an 8-foot diameter wooden globe on the WDS stage made by a local sculptor and fabricator. This WDS icon was retired last year when a new globe arrived in the Hatfild Hall lobby, but we couldn't just get rid of it. 

This year, we've incorporated our historic WDS globe in the Unconventional Race and doubled the fun. We've divded the globe into 140 peices and created two amazing races for this year's competition: a scavenger hunt and "bigger & better".

#Scavenger Hunt

Our first race is a scavenger hunt for a prized piece of the globe. Follow the first clue posted in Hatfield Hall, then keep following the clues at each of seven strategic and symbolic locations in downtown, Portland. Participants in the savenger hunt will have a shot at several prizes along the way, and the first to finish wins a free ticket to WDS 2016!

#Bigger & Better

Our second race is our own version of "Bigger & Better." Your challenge is to start with a piece of the globe and trade up for something bigger, better(or both). You can trade with fellow WDS attendees, or even strangers - just be sure to take pictures of your trades along the way. Wheover hasthe most epic item at the end also wins a free ticket to WDS 2016!

<b>RACE OBJECTIVE:</b>
Make a series of trades that are bigger or better (or both) than the original globe piece you start with. The person with the best result wins.

Two finalists will be chosen at 1pm Sunday, July 12th when the event ends. The WDS community will then vote on which participant they feel got the biggest and best final item from their trades. <b>The winner will receive a ticket to WDS 2016!<b/> Other successful participants may also be eligible for prizes.

<b>HOW TO PLAY:</b>
&nbsp;
1. The event officially starts on Friday night at the opening party kickoff and ends, Sunday 1pm (all submissions must be in by then). 
&nbsp;
2. Get your initial globe piece at the opening party Friday night or in the Hatfield Lobby area (where the bookstore is located) on Saturday.
&nbsp;
3. Convince someone to take a piece of the globe from you in exchange for something you mutually agree is either bigger or better (or both). 
&nbsp;
4. Make at least 3 trades and document each one using a digital camera or smartphone. All pictures must be either emailed to (This Address) OR uploaded to Twitter or Instagram tagged with the hashtags: #WDS2015 #WDSBiggerBetter by Sunday at 1pm.
&nbsp;
5. When the event ends, a selection committee will select finalists whose trade stories and final items will be shown on the WDS Main stage.
&nbsp;
6. The audience will then select the winner they feel got the bigger & better final item.

<b>TRADING TERMS</b>
The following rules are not intended to be all inclusive but rather general guidelines when determining if an item qualifies for a trade:

A traded item MUST be:
- A tangible, inanimate, physical object (no humans, animals, plants, or ghosts please).
- Bigger or better* (or both) than the item you’re giving away.
- Safe. Your item should not put yourself or others at risk. 
- Documented by photo. You should have at least three photos showing the progression of your trades in order to be considered a finalist. Each photo must depict the item you are giving away and the item you are receiving in exchange. 

*What does ‘better’ mean? That’s up to you to decide!

A traded item CAN be: 
• Bigger AND better at the same time.
• Traded for more than one item (i.e. a collection or a set).
• “Home-made” or store bought.
• An event represented with a tangible item (i.e.. movie or concert ticket).
• The item CAN be traded for a service represented by a tangible item as long as that service is legally redeemable (i.e. a gift card from a major restaurant chain)

A traded item CANNOT be:
• Cash, check or bitcoin.
• Belong to someone else or have any liens by other parties who could make claim to the item after the trade, (i.e. no loans or leases regarding the item).
• Permanently attached to any other property not offered as part of the exchange (i.e. a garage door still attached to the garage).
• Something that requires a fee as a condition to transfer between parties, deactivated devices are ok (i.e. a cell phone).
• Stolen property, “pirated” or “boot legged.”
• Illegal, prescription drugs, or anything “explicit” in nature. Ask yourself, “Would this embarrass Grandma?”

<b>THE NOT SO FINE PRINT</b>
By participating in this activity you are agreeing that:
- WDS is not responsible or liable for any of the items you trade or receive*.
- WDS is not responsible for any injury or accident that can occur during this activity. 
- You will interact with the public in a way that represents WDS in a positive and respectful manner.

*Be very intentional about your trades knowing that you are responsible for what to do with the final item once the race is over.

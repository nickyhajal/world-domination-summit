# WDS is growing! For the first time in history, we're inviting _everyone_ to join us for an all-new experience called WDS Connect.

<div class="zig-zags_blue"></div>
<h3 class="sub-karla">Our main stage (now called "360") experience is sold out, but you can still participate in dozens of meetups, group conversations, and even a spectactular closing party at the end of the week.</h3>

<p>Our all-new Connect tickets allow those without main-stage access to connect with all attendees through our private app.</p>

<p>With a Connect ticket, you'll have access to activities beginning on Tuesday, August 9 and continuing through Sunday, August 14. Every day will feature several optional activities that you can choose from. There will be a yoga or fitness activity in the morning, several "spark sessions" in the afternoon, and a focused group experience in the evenings. </p>

### WDS Connect Vs. WDS 360 Tickets

The best thing about WDS is always the community. With a Connect ticket, you won't be part of the immersive weekend, but you _will_ be able to hang out with awesome people (from all over the world!) who share the same values of Community, Adventure, and Service.

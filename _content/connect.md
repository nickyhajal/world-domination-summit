# WDS is growing! For the first time in history, we're inviting _everyone_ to join us for an all-new experience called WDS Connect.

<p align="center"><div class="zig-zags_blue"></div></p>
<h3 class="sub-karla">If you've just heard of WDS or weren't able to get main stage tickets earlier, it's not too late to participate. By registering for WDS Connect, you'll be able to:

<ul>
      <li>Attend (or host!) your choice of hundreds of meetups and gatherings</li>
      
      <li>Connect with worldwide attendees based on shared interests or goals</li>

      <li>Get complimentary entry to one WDS Academy (half-day workshops focused on a specific learning objective) and discounted tickets to any additional Academies ($29 per Academy)*</li>

      <li>Attend our spectacular Closing Party on Sunday, August 14th</li>
</ul></h3>



<p>With a WDS Connect ticket you can participate in dozens of activities beginning on <b>Tuesday, August 9th </b>through <b>Monday, August 15th</b>. Each day will feature several optional activities, from morning fitness to thought-provoking “Spark Sessions." Plus, you’ll get to rock out with us at our spectacular closing party on Sunday!</p>

<p>Although the WDS Connect ticket does not include main stage (now called “360”) event access, you'll have tons of opportunities to connect with interesting people from all over the world who care about <em>Community</em>, <em>Adventure</em>, and <em>Service</em>.</p>

<p>If you’ve never had the opportunity to be a part of the WDS experience, a WDS Connect ticket will give you a taste of what people travel <em>thousands</em> of miles to be a part of each year.</p>

### What is WDS?

<p>World Domination Summit (WDS) is a week-long gathering of creative, remarkable people who are asking: "How do we live a remarkable life in a conventional world?" Every summer, <em>thousands</em> of people travel from all over the world to Portland, Oregon for this immersive experience in life, work, and travel.</p>

<p>When you spend WDS with us in Portland, you’ll help us take over the city. With main-stage keynotes, hundreds of attendee-led meetups, dozens of workshops known as “Academies,” two big parties, and a ridiculous number of new friends high-fiving you on street corners, it’s a truly immersive and awesome experience.</p>

<p>WDS is operated as not-for-profit, and all proceeds at the end of the event are contributed to the WDS Foundation, funding ["Scholarships for Real Life"](https://worlddominationsummit.com/foundation).</p>

### WDS Connect Vs. WDS 360 Tickets


What is the difference between WDS Connect and WDS "360" Tickets? While both tickets give the holder access to all of the awesome activities we have planned for the week, only WDS 360 has full access to all of the parties, main-stage weekend sessions, and the Big Adventure scheduled for Friday.

### Activity Descriptions 

#### Attendee Led Meetups 
<p>These meetups are brought to you <em>by</em> WDSer’s <em>for</em> WDS’ers and are taking place all over the city. A great cup of coffee, a tasty microbrew, a stunning view of the river - you can get a taste of Portland while you connect with your community based on your own interests and passions.</p>

#### Academies
<p>Dig deep into your favorite topics with these half-day workshops, led by experts from the WDS community. From travel hacking to creating killer online enterprises, Academies are a great way to launch yourself into new adventures. [Academy tickets](https://worlddominationsummit.com/academies) are purchased separately (and discount pricing is available for Connect ticket holders).</p>

#### Spark Sessions
<p>Get ignited as this facilitated meetup session offers thought-provoking talks and hands on strategizing. Read the details for each session in your schedule.</p>

#### Mystery Bus Tour
<p>Put on your adventure pants – because you’re going on one! Board the mystery bus and see what fun awaits you. No we won’t tell you what you’re doing - you just have to jump aboard and be up for anything...we promise you’re going to have the time of your life! <b>Please bring cash and your ID for any snacks or drinks you’d like to enjoy on the way.</b></p>

#### Sunrise Yoga
<p>Sure, the sun has <em>technically</em> risen… but this is a great way for you to rise and shine. Come enjoy an outdoor yoga session overlooking the city of Portland. Center yourself with a session designed for all experience levels to be comfortable. <b>Please wear layers, as it could be a little chilly before you warm up, and a water bottle - it’s important to stay hydrated!</b></p>

#### Portland Makers Walking Tour
<p>Get to know this creative city and the people who helped build it on a walking tour of Portland. Learn a bit of Portland history and some stories of the emerging creatives of today. <b>Please wear comfortable shoes as this tour is approximately 3 miles with the occasional slight incline.</b></p>

#### Unofficial Welcome Party
<p>Almost all of the WDS 360 attendees are in town - so it’s time to get the whole community together to party! Gather at <b>Punchbowl Social</b> for games, high fives, drinks, food, and fun.</p>

#### Be a Karaoke Rockstar
<p>WDS takes over <b>Voicebox</b> for a musical explosion. Unleash your inner rockstar on the mic while you strut your stuff. Not a singer? Dance it up! Every great performer needs back up dancers. Or be the crowd that keeps everyone pumped up.</p>

#### WDS 5K Fun Run
<p>Start the morning off with a refreshing run through the city.</p>

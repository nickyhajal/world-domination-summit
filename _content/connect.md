# In August 2016, a small army of remarkable people will converge on Portland, Oregon for a weekend of community strategizing, adventure, and service.

<div class="zig-zags_blue"></div>
<h3 class="sub-karla">This time, everything will be **new**, but our guiding question will be the same: *How do we live a remarkable life in a conventional world*?</h3>

<p>The World Domination Summit (WDS) is a gathering of creative people from all over the world. Every summer thousands of awesome people travel to Portland, Oregon for an immersive experience centered around life, work, and travel.</p>

<br>
<p>There are many different ways to participate in WDS. Throughout the weekend there will be whole-crew (all of YOU!) collaborations that consist of mainstage keynote talks, world record breaking attempts (and triumphs), a mini-festival featuring many of Portland's most popular food carts and other small businesses, and (of course) great parties!</p>

<p>But what's new about WDS 2016 is the focus on small groups: more attendee-led meetups, more Academies, opportunites for artists to show their work, craft tables, and team challenges like the famed scavenger hunt of 2015. We're excited to experience more of the connection this community is so good at creating.</p>

<p>Everyone who comes to WDS is a big part of the experience, and we want everyone to have a chance to get to know you. If you want to learn more about what it's like hang out with us for the weekend, check out this short documentary from the perspective of one of our WDS 2014 attendees:</p>

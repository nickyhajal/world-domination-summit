## Submit Your Story

<!-- # The best part about WDS is you and your stories.

As we've done for the past several years, this year we'll feature stories from the WDS community that can be told in impactful, bite-size tales that are 2 minutes or less. These stories will be used in a variety of ways over the WDS weekend. 

Keep reading to learn more or nominate a story...

#Submit a Story

This year, we're looking for a few specific kinds of stories:

1. Stories about love (of all kinds), overcoming challenges, and quests or adventures (of all kinds)

2. Stories that involve a skill you can teach the WDS community in less than two minutes -- in a fun, engaging way, of course

3. Stories about how WDS has impacted your life or others

Do you have (or know of another attendee that has) an awesome story that you think the WDS Community should hear about? Tell us below:

<div id="wufoo-s1wmwbs81n6u528">
Fill out my <a href="https://worlddominationsummit.wufoo.com/forms/s1wmwbs81n6u528">online form</a>.
</div>
<script type="text/javascript">var s1wmwbs81n6u528;(function(d, t) {
var s = d.createElement(t), options = {
'userName':'worlddominationsummit',
'formHash':'s1wmwbs81n6u528',
'autoResize':true,
'height':'1374',
'async':true,
'host':'wufoo.com',
'header':'show',
'ssl':true};
s.src = ('https:' == d.location.protocol ? 'https://' : 'http://') + 'www.wufoo.com/scripts/embed/form.js';
s.onload = s.onreadystatechange = function() {
var rs = this.readyState; if (rs) if (rs != 'complete') if (rs != 'loaded') return;
try { s1wmwbs81n6u528 = new WufooForm();s1wmwbs81n6u528.initialize(options);s1wmwbs81n6u528.display(); } catch (e) {}};
var scr = d.getElementsByTagName(t)[0], par = scr.parentNode; par.insertBefore(s, scr);
})(document, 'script');</script>

### Whoa - that was a lot of stories!

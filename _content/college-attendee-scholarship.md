## World Domination College Fund: Application

# What is WDS?

The World Domination Summit (WDS) is a gathering of creative, interesting people from all over the world who value Community, Adventure, and Service. WDS brings together entrepreneurs, artists, bloggers, travelers, and others seeking to "live a remarkable life in a conventional world.” WDS takes place annually in Portland, Oregon. This year will be the fifth annual gathering, taking place on July 9 -13, 2015.

The weekend consists of main-stage events with keynote speakers at the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall and lots of meetups, side events, and informal engagement. Despite the large number of people who attend, WDS is an introvert-friendly zone, and everyone who participates is a big part of the event.

You can check out WDS 2014 with this short film highlighting one particular attendee who had an experience she'll never forget:

WDS was founded by <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/about/" target="_blank">Chris Guillebeau</a>, explorer of the world and New York Times bestselling author of The $100 Startup.

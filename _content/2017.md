### What Is WDS?

<p>Now entering its seventh year, World Domination Summit (WDS) is an annual, week-long gathering of creative, remarkable people who seek to answer the question: "How do we live a remarkable life in a conventional world?" Every summer, thousands of people travel from all over the world to Portland, Oregon for this immersive experience in life, work, and travel.</p>

<p>When you spend WDS with us in Portland, you’ll help us take over the city. With main-stage keynotes, hundreds of attendee-led meetups, dozens of workshops known as “Academies,” two big parties, and a ridiculous number of new friends high-fiving you on street corners, it’s a truly immersive and awesome experience.</p>

<p>WDS operates as a not-for-profit, with all ticket revenue going toward the cost of the event and the WDS Foundation, funding ["Scholarships for Real Life"](https://worlddominationsummit.com/foundation).</p>

### A Welcoming Place to Find Your Tribe

Despite the large number of people who attend, WDS is an introvert-friendly zone, and everyone who participates is a big part of the event. </p>

            <li> <b>Priority access:</b> Attendees who pre-register will recieve first access to registration for Academies, as well as a free Insider Access pass to one Academy</li>
      <li> <b>Save money:</b> Each pre-registration ticket includes a $100 discount, so each ticket you purchase now instead of later saves you money </li>
      <li> <b>Bring a friend:</b> When you take advantage of our pre-sell discount, you can puchase up to 2 additional tickets for friends and family, without having them compete for tickets and pay a higher price later</li>
            <li> <b>Support the community:</b> Purchasing a ticket now helps us plan for next year. We couldn't do it without you!

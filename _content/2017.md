### What is WDS?

<p>World Domination Summit (WDS) is a week-long gathering of creative, remarkable people who are asking: "How do we live a remarkable life in a conventional world?" Every summer, <em>thousands</em> of people travel from all over the world to Portland, Oregon for this immersive experience in life, work, and travel.</p>

<p>When you spend WDS with us in Portland, you’ll help us take over the city. With main-stage keynotes, hundreds of attendee-led meetups, dozens of workshops known as “Academies,” two big parties, and a ridiculous number of new friends high-fiving you on street corners, it’s a truly immersive and awesome experience.</p>

<p>WDS is operated as not-for-profit, and all proceeds at the end of the event are contributed to the WDS Foundation, funding ["Scholarships for Real Life"](https://worlddominationsummit.com/foundation).</p>

### How Can I Participate?

There are many different ways to participate in WDS. Throughout the week there will be whole-crew (all of YOU!) collaborations that consist of mainstage keynote talks, world record breaking attempts (and triumphs), a mini-festival featuring many of Portland's most popular food carts and other small businesses, and (of course) great parties!

Despite the large number of people who attend, WDS is an introvert-friendly zone, and everyone who participates is a big part of the event. Want to learn more about what the experience of attending WDS is like? Check out this short documentary from the perspective of one of our WDS 2014 attendees:

### What are the Benefits of Purchasing a Ticket Now?

<ul>
      <li> <b>Support the community:</b> Here at WDS there is no pledge drive, no crowdfunding—this is it! Plus, WDS is completely non-profit, so all of the money from your purchase goes directly back into the community.</li>
      <li> <b>Bring a friend:</b> When you take advantage of our pre-sell discount, you can puchase up to 2 additional tickets for friends and family saving you $300.</li>
      <li> <b>Save money!:</b> Pre-sell tickets are marked down by $100, so each ticket you purchase now instead of later saves you money. </li>
      <li> <b>Priority access (hotel reservation, Academies):</b> This is the only way to get an Insider Access ticket, so there are even more savings!</li>
      <li><b>Guaranteed spot:</b> With a pre-sell ticket there's no need to rush or compete with anyone else. Tickets for our Main-stage weekend events sell out quickly year after year, but purchasing a pre-sell ticket ensures that you get to join in on all of the fun for 2017.</li>
</ul>
### And trust us, 2017 is going to be absolutely amazing—you don't want to miss out. We can't wait to see you there!<br><br>

# WDS Local: Living out our remarkable lives in community

<a name="about"></a>

<div class="zig-zags_blue"></div>

Since our very first WDS in 2011 the alumni community has grown to over 10,000 adventurers from around the world representing over 40+ different countries. As the alumni community has grown, many have been looking for a way to meet in smaller groups in their hometowns to support each other in living out the WDS mission and core values. 

We're excited to officially introduce:

WDS Local is a way that alumni can gather regularly through out the year, support each other, and bring WDS home to their local communities. It's a way to continue conversations and go on new adventures together outside the annual WDS gathering in Portland. We know that the best thing about WDS is you, the people who make up this vibrant and wonderful community. And there's nothing better than for awesome people to hang out more often with other awesome people. 

We need <i>you</i>.

### How to Get Involved

At the moment several groups are already meeting regularly and more are being launched each month. Our goal is to help launch WDS Local groups in areas where there are at least 3 people that are willing to meet on a regular basis. The focus is not about how many people get together, but solely on the commitment that members of these groups have to each other. The success of WDS Local groups is solely dependent on the commitmment and active participation of it's members. 

*WDS Local is for anyone that:*
<ul>
  <li>Lives out the <a href="https://worlddominationsummit.com/story">WDS mission and core values</a></li>
  <li>Has previously attended a WDS</li>
  <li>OR personally knows a WDS alum and is planning to be an active member of the WDS community</li>
  <li>Wants to meet and get to know other awesome WDS community members</li>
  <li>Wants to help others live out their remarkable lives</li>
</ul>

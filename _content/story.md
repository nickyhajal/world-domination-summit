# Way back in 2011 we invited 500 friends to Portland, Oregon. Our common curiosity brought us together to explore one question: *How do we live a remarkable life in a conventional world?*

Fast forward to 2015 and we’re still exploring that question every summer, with an in-person gathering that has now included more than 10,000 people. The stakes and stories have grown each year with new adventures like [Bollywood dancing](/speakers/dj-prashant), hot air balloon rides, [Guiness World Record](/2014-world-record) setting, and a foundation that offers grants to individuals to pursue their dreams and positively impact their community. We call them [“Scholarships for Real Life”](/foundation).

In August 2016 we’re doing it again and inviting all our friends (you!) to PDX for our sixth *World Domination Summit* (WDS). Some things this year will be new, but our core principles of *Community*, *Adventure*, and *Service* will continue to guide our pursuit of *living remarkable lives in a conventional world*. Want to [join us](/register)?

**What It’s Like**
 
When you spend WDS with us in Portland, you’ll help us take over the city. With main-stage keynotes, hundreds of attendee-led meetups, dozens of workshops known as “Academies,” a city-wide scavenger hunt, a Guinness World Record Attempt, big parties, and thousands of new friends high-fiving you on street corners, it’s a truly immersive and awesome experience.
 
Everyone who comes to WDS is a big part of it and you make this community strong and independent with no corporate sponsorship and nothing for sale during the event except books from our speakers. If you want to learn more about what it's like to hang out with us, check out this short documentary from the perspective of one of our previous attendees:

**The Plan for 2016**

For 2016 we’re very excited to introduce new WDS mini-events held throughout the city including art shows, performances, a 5k, and many more independent gatherings, and to extend our time together to an entire week (no-longer just the weekend). We’re also adding to our popular [Academies](/academies) to incorporate many more attendee's interests.

We’ll once again be making our main stage home at the Newmark theater (where we were in 2012) – a beautiful and intimate theater with 1,000 seats. Since there are fewer seats in this theater, there are fewer tickets this year for main-stage keynote attendance, but many other WDS events will be offered through separate ticket purchases.

**Tickets**

During the pre-sale at WDS 2015 we limited ticket purchases for the main stage keynotes to 500, so there are exactly 500 more seats available. We'll release the next 500 to everyone on a first-come, first-served basis, likely in two rounds of ticket sales.
 
But remember: Even if you don’t buy tickets for the main stage keynotes, separate tickets will be available for many of the other WDS events taking place throughout the week. Everyone is welcome!

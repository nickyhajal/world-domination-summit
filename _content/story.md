# Way back in 2011, we invited 500 friends to Portland, Oregon. Our common curiosity brought us together to explore one question: *How do we live a remarkable life in a conventional world?*

Fast forward to 2016 and we’re still exploring that question every summer, with an in-person gathering that has now included more than 10,000 people since we started. The stakes and stories have grown each year with activities like Bollywood dancing, leveling up with [Academies](/academies), Guiness World Records, and the creation of a foundation that offers grants to individuals to pursue their dreams and positively impact their community. We call them [“Scholarships for Real Life”](/foundation).

In July 2017 we’ll be doing it again and inviting all our friends (you!) to Portland for the Seventh *World Domination Summit* (WDS). Some things this year will be new, but our core principles of *Community*, *Adventure*, and *Service* will continue to guide our shared pursuit of changing the world.

# **What It’s Like**
 
When you spend WDS with us in Portland, you’ll help us take over the city. With main-stage keynotes, hundreds of attendee-led meetups, dozens of workshops known as “Academies,” adventure activities, two big parties, and hundreds of new friends high-fiving you on street corners, it’s a truly immersive and awesome experience.
 
Everyone who comes to WDS is a big part of everything that happens. Our attendees make the community strong and independent with no corporate sponsorships. 

To learn more about what it's like to hang out with us, check out this short documentary from the perspective of one of our previous attendees:

# This year, nearly 3,000 people descended on Portland, Oregon for the fourth annual World Domination Summit. It was an adventure like no other, complete with [Bollywood dancing](/speakers/dj-prashant), hammock races, non-stop meetups, and our very own [world record](/2014-world-record) for the largest yoga chain.

Oh, **and** we also had a *program*... with great speakers and workshops. A.J. Jacobs showed us how we were all related. Jadah Sellner brought the crowd to its feet, and planetwalker John Francis told us about his 17-year journey. John Jantsch fulfilled a lifelong dream of becoming an actual rockstar.

One year later, we're scaling up... carefully. WDS 2014 sold out months in advance with a waiting list of 5,000 people. At least four hundred people without tickets showed up from out of town just to hang out at unofficial events.

This time, we're prepared â€” and World Domination can no longer be contained to a single theater. Instead, we're taking over the whole city.

Revisit WDS 2014 with through the lens of one attendee who had an experience she'll never forget:

**The Plan for 2015**

Our main stage events will be held in the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall, a 2900-seat venue that includes a key feature: thanks to two tiers of seating, no seat is more than 100 feet from the stage. Even with a large group of awesome people, it will still be intimate.

For the second year, WDS will produce the *Portland Experience*, a mini-festival held in the park blocks behind the theater on Saturday afternoon. An expanded set of half-day [Academies](/academies) will also take place on the days surrounding the big weekend. You'll want to come early!

As WDS 2015 approaches, we'll be booking out every room possible in our partner hotels. Hostels and other shared housing options are also available. And for the fifth year running, we'll have our signature Highly Sensitive Person Lounge with soothing hammocks, green tea, and licensed massage therapists on hand for those who need a break.

In short WDS 2015 will be an experience like no other. We hope to see you there!

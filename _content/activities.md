# When main stage sessions end for the afternoon, the good times roll on. Join your fellow attendees at your choice of extracurricular activities around town—from film screenings and river cruises to world record attempts and more!

If these aren't your cup of tea (or if you just can't get enough), be sure to check out the [WDS academies](/academies). And don't forget all the attendee meetups that will be organized through our attendee hub.

		<h4>Summary</h4>
		You'd better believe we're coming back this year with another world record attempt. This year, we're tackling the world's longest yoga chain.
		
		At 8:30 AM on Friday, July 11th, you'll join your fellow WDS attendees and local Portlanders as we team up downtown at Pioneer Courthouse Square to bring that record to Portland!

It will take 697 of us to swipe the record away from India. Are you up for it?

		<h4>Summary</h4>
		Friends and fellow world dominators,

Abraham Lincoln once said, "All I need to be happy in life is a yacht, some good company, and a bag of Doritos."

That is, of course, a lie. But if it were true, it would cleverly underscore just how amazing it'll be if you join us on Saturday night, July 6th for a cruise through Portland on the famous Portland Spirit—our very own yacht, or at least our very own yacht for a few hours.

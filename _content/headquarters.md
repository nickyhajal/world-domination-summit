<h3>Your Base in Portland, Oregon</h3>
<p>
	We'll base out of the Antoinette Hatfield Hall, located two blocks from a light-rail stop and directly across from the south park blocks. On Saturday morning, one of the city's main Farmer's Markets will be open in the park, with cupcakes, fresh vegetables, and local art available for sale.

<h3 class="side-icon-moon">Lodging</h3>
<p>Portland is an affordable destination, with the lowest hotel rates of any major west coast city. Every year we arrange a number of discounts from partner hotels. Other attendees rent through AirBnB or stay at a local hostel.
<p>
We'll be launching our official hotel partners list for WDS 2017 soon but here is an example list of hotels we partnered with last year:</p>

<h3 class="side-icon-streetcar">Transportation</h3>
<p>For all of these options, Portland's fast-and-easy light rail service goes directly from the airport to downtown for $2.50 - no need to rent a car during your whole time in the city. You can also come a day early or stay a day late, and the discount hotel rates are valid during the entire week surrounding the summit.</p>

<h3 class="side-icon-fork">Food &amp; Dining</h3>

Portland is known for its 400+ **food carts**, located in 25 “pods” throughout the city. One popular pod is located at SW 10th and Alder. If you’re on the east side of town across the bridge, head to Cartopia at SE 12th and Hawthorne. For more information, check out <a href="foodcartsportland.com" target ="_blank">Food Carts Portland</a>. 
	
A number of **great restaurants** are within easy walking distance or streetcar ride to the Pearl District. Some good restaurants in the area include Clyde Common (Ace Hotel), Metrovino, Grüner, Via Tri- bunali, Andina, Luc Lac, Little Bird, and Tasty and Alder. Sandwiches are available at Lardo and Addie’s. More options at <a href="http://pdx.eater.com/maps/best-portland-restaurants-38" target ="_blank">PDX Eater's 38 Essential Portland restaurants guide</a>.

Portland’s world class **farmers market** is just down the street on the PSU campus. Check it out on Saturday from 8:30am to 2pm for tons of locally sourced prepared food and produce vendors. Just follow the park blocks all the way south until you hit the Portland State University campus. More information at <a href="http://www.portlandfarmersmarket.org/our-markets/psu/" target ="_blank">Portland Farmers Market</a>.

Rumor has it that the creative class was recruited to Portland on the basis of its **coffee shops**. To decide for yourself, check out Crema, Albina Press, Rocking Frog, Fresh Pot, Barista, Daily Cafe, or any number of Stumptown spots.

<h3 class="side-icon-bridge">City</h3>
<p>
	You'll have the chance to wander and explore. In short, it will be an amazing weekend in an incredible city (and for those attending from nearby, you'll enjoy meeting new friends while showing off our funky neighborhoods).
</p>

**Hawthorne Neighborhood**

Stock up on your mustache wax in the hipster capital of the universe! Get there on the 14 bus, which stops at SW Madison and 4th, then get off about 10 minutes later on Hawthorne Boulevard, anywhere between 20th and 39th streets.

**West Side / Downtown Neighborhoods**

Northwest and the Pearl District, reachable by streetcar or a stroll, are the trendy side to Hawthorne’s old-school vibe. Check out the area around NW 23rd, with nice pubs and good ethnic food options.

**Powell’s Books**

No trip to Portland is complete without a pilgrimage to Powell’s City of Books, located on an entire city block at 1005 W Burnside.

**Waterfront**

Walk, jog, or bike the waterfront area, starting in the south end and continuing to the Steel Bridge near the train station area.

	<h3>Welcome!</h3>
	<p>
		Congratulations! You're about to embark on the race of a lifetime that will have you meeting other WDSers, exploring Portland, and probably doing a few things you weren't expecting to during your time here.
	</p>
	<p>
		To qualify for the big prizes, there are a few things you need to know. This guide will walk you through everything.
	</p>
	<p>
		Just click continue to get started!

	<p>
	To begin, there are 3 types of tasks: automatic tasks, photo tasks, and video tasks. Each are a bit different so let's go through them one by one.
	</p>
	<h3>Automatic Tasks</h3>
	<p>
		With automatic tasks, you'll be awarded points for actions you take on the WDS site.  For instance, you'll get a point just for completing this guide!
	</p>
	<p>
		Some automatic tasks involve marking other attendees as friends on the WDS site. In those cases, <i>they must also friend you</i> to achieve the task - this is about
		developing real relationships!
	</p>
<a href="#" class="button tab-next">Continue</a>
</div>
<div id="tab-panel-photo" class="tab-panel">
	<h3>Photo Upload Tasks</h3>
	<p>
		Many items are "photo upload" tasks.  To be awarded points for these tasks, you'll have to upload a photo via the race interface.  
	</p>
	<p>If you're using a smart phone, our system will integrate directly with your camera or 
		existing photo library. If you're using a computer, you can upload an existing photo you have.
	</p>
	<p>
		The upload may take a moment to complete, especially if your internet connection isn't great. Please be patient while on the loading screen to be sure your submission is sent successfully.
	</p>
	<p><strong>P.S.</strong>We want to see you take <i>really</i> creative photos. Spend some time setting up your shots. Make sure your smiling face is in it -- plain pictures of things are boring -- and try create something memorable. If you do, we'll share it with the whole community.
	</p>
<a href="#" class="button tab-next">Continue</a>
</div>
<div id="tab-panel-video" class="tab-panel">
	<h3>Video Tasks</h3>
	<p>
		What's better than a funny video? This year's race integrates with <b>instagram</b>
		to make video tasks easy and fun!
	</p>
	<p>
		First, make sure you've added your instagram username to your WDS account in your account settings page.
	</p><p>

		Then, all you need to do is record a video with instagram and give it 2 special hashtags. The first is <b>#wds2015</b>. The second is a custom tag unique to each video task you'll find on the task details page.
	</p>
	<p>
		We have special WDS robots checking every instagram video in the #wds2015 feed and they'll make sure to process your submission! (Though they may take a few minutes - they're not the fastest robots in the world.)
	</p>
<a href="#" class="button tab-next">Continue</a>

<div id="tab-panel-upload" class="tab-panel">
	<h3>Important: Judging</h3>
	<p>
		After posting a photo or video, that task will be marked as complete. However,
		The Unconventional Race team will be judging every submission.
	</p>
	<p>
		Creative photos can receive up to 3 bonus points. In a tight race, as the Unconventional Race tends to be, bonus points can make or break your shot at victory!
	</p>
	<p>
		Photos that seem irrelevant to the task or don't meet the specified criteria will be removed. If that happens, you'll be able to submit another time to try again.
	</p>
<a href="#" class="button tab-next">Continue</a>
</div>
<div id="tab-panel-honor" class="tab-panel">
	<h3>Honor System</h3>
	<p>
		Much of the race, up until verification, is based on the honor system, so be cool.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Don't cross things off you haven't done.  Don't "friend" people you didn't actually meet, and let's make this fair and fun for everyone.
	</p>
	<a href="#" class="button tab-next">Continue</a>
</div>
<div id="tab-panel-fun" class="tab-panel">
	<h3>Most Important</h3>
	<p>
		Have fun!  This is meant to enhance your experience here at WDS.  Don't stress about it, just enjoy yourself and have an adventure you'll remember for years to come!
	</p>
	<h3>Questions? Need help?</h3>
	<p>
		If you have questions about the race you can call Sean at 503-985-8785 and he'll make sure you get taken care of.

# As the WDS community strengthens and grows, more and more people are arriving early and staying late. 2014 marked the launch of WDS Academies: a series of mini-events focused on specific topics that take place on the days surrounding WDS weekend. Take a look at a recap video of last year's Academies. 

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/121164251?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="570" height="321" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>


We're excited to announce that Academies are back for 2015! This year's Academies includes a wide range of awesome topics and features several favorite WDS speakers from over the years. 

Registration for Academies is separate from WDS itself, and we offer registration both to WDS attendees as well as to the general public (for a slightly higher registration fee). Because they are hosted at different venues around Portland, please note that there is a separate registration process for each Academy you would like to attend. 

There is no limit on how many Academies you can register for. Academy tickets are capacity controlled and offered on a first-come first-served basis. Once an Academy session sells out, we will not be issuing extra tickets, and all tickets are non-refundable and non-transferrable. 

<b>PLEASE NOTE: Registration for 2015 Academies will go live Tuesday, May 5th.</b>

Learn why "following your passion" is bad advice for people wanting to build this type of business. Practice the easiest way to start making money from anywhere, that you can apply today.

	<h4>The Art of Becoming Known</h4>
	Hosted by Jonathan Fields
	<div class="collapsable-content">
	Thursday, July 9, 2015 from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM
		<h4>Summary</h4>
		Platform-building, thought-leadership, expertise and authority. #YAWN. 

Becoming “known” can open a lot of doors. But, beyond ego-gratification, it's worthless UNLESS you know how to do it in a way that aligns deeply with both who you are AND what you seek to build. Do it right, the doors to purpose, possibility and connection swing open. Do it wrong, pretty much everything crashes and burns. 

This academy is about doing it right, and creating something that matters--to you and to those you seek to serve--along the way.
Attendees of this Academy will leave with: A dynamic, highly-effective roadmap to grow your notoriety in a way that opens the most doors, cultivates the most meaning and let's you feel amazing about how you're doing it. A deep understanding of the different paths to building a business, practice, career or body-of-work around your growing notoriety. A simple process to choose the best tools, platforms and medium for your social orientation and communication DNA. A checklist of critical mistakes to avoid and shiny objects to stop chasing. A better ability to handle the real challenges, responsibilities and opportunities that inevitably come your way as you become better known.

		Lots of people dream of down-sizing to reduce their debt, to focus on what's important, or to facilitate the creation of a new community (think my brother want's to move in with me and my husband, or I'd love to invite my aging Mom to live with us). So what are the possibilities, challenges, and realities of taking the plunge toward tiny?
If you've considered tiny living, then this is a chance to learn from the experts who have put their passion and knowledge into establishing tiny house communities.

		Dee Williams of Portland Alternative Dwellings is a builder, teacher, author. She’s co-owner of Portland Alternative Dwellings (www.padtinyhouses.com), a company founded on the principle that everyone can build the life they dream. Dee's memoir, The Big Tiny (2014 Penguin/Random House), chronicles her journey toward voluntary simplicity, life in a micro-house, and the realization that there’s nothing better than a chance to say “Thank You” and “I Love You.” Really. Seriously. Dee lives in Olympia, Washington in an 84-sq.ft house, which is the epi-center of something more massive than the ever-expanding universe... and that place is called “HOME.”

Caravan, The Tiny House Hotel is located in the heart of the Alberta district of NE Portland, OR. It is the first tiny house (on wheels) hotel in America and owners, Deb Delman and Kol Peterson, are avid tiny house (wheels or built on the ground) enthusiasts. Dee, Deb and Kol and their combined experience with building, engaging city code enforcement, and tiny house living make this an awesome opportunity to explore tiny. -->

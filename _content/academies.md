# As WDS grows, more and more people are arriving early and staying late. This year marks the launch of WDS Academies: a series of mini-events focused on specific topics that take place on the days surrounding WDS weekend. 

Registration for academies is separate from WDS itself. We'll offer registration first to WDS attendees, and then (depending on capacity) to the general public. Stay tuned for details to be announced after the final wave of WDS ticket sales.

		<h4>Summary</h4>
		Nerd Fitness Academy Live will help you develop the skills you need to become a real life superhero. We’ll start by training our minds to process a totally different approach to fitness—one that breaks the rampant boom and bust fitness trends and leads to long-term sustainable habit change. We’ll then talk about how simple, small changes in our diet can “level up” our nutrition (and allow each attendee to achieve new personal results they didn’t think were really possible). Finally, we’ll demonstrate and perform a strength training workout that you can do ANYWHERE in the world. Everything we teach and share is based around the philosophy that we are normal, everyday people wanting a fun, sustainable, and genuine way to lead better lives together.

		<h4>About Steve Kamb</h4>
		Steve Kamb is the creator and leader of NerdFitness.com, a fitness community dedicated to helping average Joes and desk jockeys live healthier lives. Over the past five years, he's taken Nerd Fitness from a simple one-man blog and developed it into a passionate “rebellion” of over 190,000 email subscribers, with hundreds joining the cause every day. While teaching others to get healthy, he's also managed to complete some pretty cool quests: exploring the ruins of Machu Picchu in Peru and Angkor Wat in Cambodia, diving with sharks on the Great Barrier Reef, flying a stunt plane in New Zealand, and living like James Bond in Monte Carlo.

	<h5>9:00 am–4:00 pm</h5>
	Hosted by Bennie Lewis
	<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/wds-academy-language-lab-with-benny-lewis-tickets-11583991029" class="button">Tickets &rarr;</a>
	<div class="collapsable-content">
		<h4>Summary</h4>
		"Some day" you'll learn a new language? Make "some day" TODAY. We will be tackling your doubts, and then giving you the hacks you need to have a basic conversation in any language you may want to learn, by the end of the lab. Then you will open up a whole new world, unreachable by English alone, and have the tools to skyrocket towards fluency after WDS. Anyone at any age can learn any language in the world. Talent is irrelevant.

By the end of this Academy all language doubts will be squashed. Find out why adults are BETTER language learners than children, how to learn your language even if you are busy, and especially how to do it even if you can't travel abroad.
		
		<h4>About Bennie Lewis</h4>
		Benny Lewis failed in language learning when growing up—getting a C in German, and spending six entire months living in Spain without able to ask the most basic questions in Spanish. But then everything changed! He now speaks 12 languages and runs the world's largest blog about language learning, "Fluent in 3 Months" and has this year released a book of the same title that became an instant international best seller. His travels through language learning have also earned him the title of National Geographic's Traveler of the Year.

	<h5>3:00 pm–6:00 pm</h5>
	Hosted by Jonathan Fields
	<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/wds-academy-revolutionu-with-jonathan-fields-tickets-11557391469" class="button">Tickets &rarr;</a>
	<div class="collapsable-content">
		<h4>Summary</h4>
		In this WDS Academy, Fields will reveal the entire 18-step RevolutionU Framework, a highly-detailed, immediately-actionable roadmap to engineer your own business revolution, whether you’re just starting up or you need to breathe new life into your organization, venture or brand. Imagine how it will feel to fuel your business with the power of revolution.

		<h4>About the Jonathan Fields</h4>
		Nobody had any idea award-winning author, serial entrepreneur and Good Life Project founder, Jonathan Fields, was working on this. Not even his closest friends. Until he revealed it for the first time at an invite-only event just last year. When he did, jaws dropped.

For years, Jonathan had been working in secret to deconstruct the key elements of nonviolent revolution and figure out how to apply them to entrepreneurship. Adding evangelist growth mechanics, social technology, response marketing, social dynamics and entrepreneurship to the mix, pieces of the puzzle began to fall into place. And by mid-2013, he'd developed an integrated, robust "business revolution" framework capable of fueling entrepreneurial movements that hold the potential for exponential growth and impact.

	<div class="collapsable-content">
		<h4>Summary</h4>
		This is a big, fun exploration of collaboration: how to do more of it, how to invite others into your work, what not to do. It will also be the launch of a co-creative art/story project by Gary Hirsch where participants take (literally) original artwork from the artist and use it as a launch pad for their own art, work, and stories.

In the session you'll play, collaborate, tell stories, get some free cool stuff, work with strangers, and let go a bit, which is always a good thing. This is a great session to get help with something that you are currently working on, and have a ridiculously good time!

		<h4>About Gary Hirsch</h4>
		Gary Hirsch is a collaboration junkie and the co-founder of On Your Feet, a consultancy that uses improvisation and other interactive methods to help organizations generate new ideas, collaborate, engage audiences and walk their talk. After improv, Gary’s second love is art making, which is rooted in collaboration as well. Currently he is obsessed with making and launching thousands of small hand-painted domino robots into the world to see what will happen. Story telling, improvisation, and doodling are all inter-related for Gary, when he’s doing any of these there are never enough hours in the day.

		<h4>Summary</h4>
		Just what is “simple living,” anyway? And why does it seem to hard to… well, do? Conventional culture often defines living simply with a bunch of rules: shun the TV, ride only your bike, grow your own food, shower only when others complain. But the real definition is delightfully freeing, and it can be fleshed out in any lifestyle, at any age, at any place in the world. In this workshop, we’ll explore what living simply might look like for you. First, we’ll relish in the real definition of simple living. Then, you’ll find time and space to deconstruct parts of your life, followed by freedom to reassemble them using a new-to-you blueprint. Roll up your sleeves and treat yourself to a morning/an afternoon of personal reflection, brainstorming, and if you want, a chance to bounce around some fresh ideas on the nuts and bolts of making it all work. (Introverts who thrive on solo reflection are just as welcome as extroverts who need to chat it all out.) Bring your journal and a pencil for this one.

		<h4>About Tsh Oxenreider</h4>
		Tsh Oxenreider is passionate about people living simply so that others can simply live, and also firmly believes that a passport is one of life's greatest textbooks. She's the author of three books, including the new *Notes From a Blue Bike: The Art of Living Intentionally in a Chaotic World*, and is the founder and chief spearheader of TheArtofSimple.net, a community blog about simple living. Tsh and her family travel frequently, but right now they live in beautiful Bend, Oregon.

# Since 2014 we've been welcoming back alumni WDS speakers and other special guests who want to share their knowledge and experience in a half-day workshop setting. It's been a great way to lead into the main events of WDS weekend, and keep the conversations going after the weekend.

At a WDS Academy, you might learn how to travel hack your way to the dream trip you've always wanted to take, discover the science behind happiness, or begin building greater community. You'll have the opportunity to learn something new to help you live your <i>own</i> remarkable life story.

This short video shows more of what it's all about:

Academies will return for WDS 2017 but until then, feel free to look through this past year's Academies schedule (below) to get a sense of topics that are generally covered. 

<!-- We're excited to announce that Academies are back in 2016! We're extending this year's Academies to include a wide range of awesome topics and feature several favorite WDS speakers from over the years.

Registration for Academies is separate from WDS itself, and we offer registration both to WDS attendees as well as to the general public (for a slightly higher registration fee). Please note, if you are attending WDS (360 or Connect), please log in to your WDS account before making your Academy selection. 

**Each Academy has a limited number of free "Insider Access" seats only available to WDS 360 and Connect attendees on a first-come, first-serve basis.**

There is no limit to how many Academies you can register for but please note that you can only purchase Academies for yourself. No physical ticket or confirmation will be required upon check in, just a valid photo ID. Academy tickets are capacity controlled and offered on a first-come, first-served basis. All tickets are <b>non-refundable</b> and <b>non-transferrable</b>. 

If you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact our concierge team at <b><font color="orange">concierge@wds.fm</font></b>. 

**Please Note: registration for WDS Academies is currently open, only for WDS 360 attendees. Registration for WDS Connect and the general public will go live June 6th.**
